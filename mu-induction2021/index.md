## Summer work

As explained in the video, have a go at these exercises. **Bring them to your first Music lesson in September.**

## Preparing for September

### Theory

<https://www.musictheory.net> is a useful website for learning, revising and testing your general music theory knowledge.

In the Lessons section, review your knowledge of all sections from *The Basics* to *Intervals*.

In September we will quickly cover the remaining sections (*Chords*, *Diatonic Chords*...), so having been through them already will be a great help to you.

### Music history and listening

Tom Pankhurst's [Short History of Music](https://alevelmusic.com/4-short-history-of-music/) is a great overview of the areas we will be studying, plus a little context before and after. The most successful candidates arrive in September with a working knowledge of Music history.

The musical examples and cultural explanations are excellent and well worth working through.

Other useful listening:

* NPR has an enormous wealth of music and high-quality articles. This is my favourite at the moment: <https://www.npr.org/series/149402322/take-five-by-instrument>
* Tom Service’s series on symphonies: <https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog+series/50-greatest-symphonies> 


Wider reading:

* ‘The Rest is Noise’ – Alex Ross
* ‘A Very Short Introduction to Music’ – Nicholas Cook
* ‘The History of Jazz’ – Ted Gioia

Video (available on streaming services and Youtube):

* ‘Jazz’ – Ken Burns documentary series
* ‘1959, the year that changed Jazz’
* ‘Al Murray’s German Adventure’



### Performing

Performing accounts for 30% of the A level. In lessons we will focus on the Appraising (40%) and Composing (30%) elements, but that does not mean you can neglect your performance skills. The summer break is a great time to get ahead with your practice and to begin to consider your performance recital. (10–12 minutes in Year 13).

When you arrive in the Autumn term we will discuss the pieces you are preparing and begin to arrange performing opportunities with our accompanists.
