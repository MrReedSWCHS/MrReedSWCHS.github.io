## Theory

<https://www.musictheory.net> is a useful website for learning, revising and testing your general music theory knowledge.

In the Lessons section, review your knowledge of all sections from *The Basics* to *Intervals*.

In September we will quickly cover the remaining sections (*Chords*, *Diatonic Chords*...), so having been through them already will be a great help to you.

## Music history

Tom Pankhurst's [Short History of Music](https://alevelmusic.com/4-short-history-of-music/) is a great overview of the areas we will be studying, plus a little context before and after. The most successful candidates arrive in September with a working knowledge of Music history.

The musical examples and cultural explanations are excellent and well worth working through.

## Performing

Performing accounts for 30% of the A level. In lessons we will focus on the Appraising (40%) and Composing (30%) elements, but that does not mean you can neglect your performance skills. The summer break is a great time to get ahead with your practice and to begin to consider your performance recital. (10â€“12 minutes in Year 13).

When you arrive in the Autumn term we will discuss the pieces you are preparing and begin to arrange performing opportunities with our accompanists.
