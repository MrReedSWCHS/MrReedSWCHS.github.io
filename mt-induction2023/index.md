# Tech Induction 2023

We hope you enjoyed the Induction at SWCHS this year. Here is some extra information for getting started on the Music Technology course.

Please read all of the information on this page carefully.

Do get in touch with me at ereed-at-swchs.net if you have any questions.

# Preparing for September

These are the three important things to sort out before September:

1. Preparation work: deadline will be our first lesson so that we can discuss in class.
1. Headphones: deadline 25th September at the latest.
1. Revision Guide: deadline 25th September at the latest.


## 1. Preparation Work

This was provided on paper during Induction. Alternatively, [click here](https://github.com/reedmusic/reedmusic.github.io/raw/master/mt-induction2022/Tech Preparation.docx) to download the preparation work (you may need to right-click and Save As). Please bring this to **your first lesson in September**. Let me know if you have any questions; address above.

### Getting ready guide

To help students get ahead for their new course, the school has published a series of (optional) activities to bridge the gap between Y11 and Y12. [Click here](https://github.com/reedmusic/reedmusic.github.io/raw/master/mt-induction2022/Getting%20ready%20Mt%202022.docx) to download the Getting Ready for A Level Music Technology guide.

## 2. Headphones

You will need a good-quality pair of headphones during every lesson during the course, as well as for external exams and completing coursework. You do not need to spend a lot of money, but the headphones must be designed for studio use.

These should be closed-back, circumaural (cover your ears entirely), wired headphones (not wireless, bluetooth,etc.).

Here are some suggestions:

* AKG K52
* Sennheiser HD206 (or HD201 which are cheaper and have a long cable for studio tracking)
* AKG K92
* Audio Technia ATH-M40x (I don’t recommend the cheaper M20x/M30x)
* Sony MDR-7506
* Audio Technica ATH-M50X
* Beyerdynamic DT770

**You will need a suitable set by the third week of September 25th at the latest.**

Again, please email if you have any questions.

## 3. Revision Guide

The Revision Guide (RRP £13.99) is excellent. It is concise and covers most of the course content. Make sure you buy the ‘A Level’ and not ‘AS Level’ version. It is not just for revision: we will be referring to the diagrams and explanations routniely during lessons. You will be asked to bring this every lesson, along with your headphones.

* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Edexcel-Level-Music-Technology-Revision/dp/1785586343)
* [Musicroom](https://www.musicroom.com/edexcel-a-level-music-technology-revision-guide-rhg348)
* [Abebooks](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31259232993)

Shops are often out of stock when everyone starts courses in September, so buying this in advance is a good idea.

**You will need a copy by September 25th at the latest.**

### Additional reading

Our highest-achieving students are avid listeners, readers and engineers. Here are three more books that they find useful.
