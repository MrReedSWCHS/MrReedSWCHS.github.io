# Jobs for September
These are the important things to get sorted before September:

* Preparation work
* Headphones
* Revision Guide


1. Preparation Work
[Click here](Preparation.docx) to download the Preparation Work (you may need to right-click and Save As). Please bring this in September. Let me know if you have any questions.

2. Headphones
You will need a good-quality pair of headphones. You do not need to spend a lot of money, but the headphones must be designed for studio use.

These should be closed-back, circumaural, wired headphones. No Beats, Bose, noise-cancelling, earbuds or wireless: these won’t be suitable.

Here are some suggestions.

AKG K52
Sennheiser HD206 (or HD201 which are cheaper and have a long cable for studio tracking)
AKG K92
Audio Technia ATH-M40x (I don’t recommend the cheaper M20x/M30x)
Sony MDR-7506
Audio Technica ATH-M50X
Beyerdynamic DT770
3. Revision Guide
The Revision Guide (RRP £10) is excellent. It is concise and covers most of the course content. Make sure you buy the ‘A Level’ and not ‘AS Level’ version. It is not just for revision: we will be referring to the diagrams and explanations in class.

Here is the Amazon link

Shops are usually out of stock in September, so I strongly suggest buying this in advance.
