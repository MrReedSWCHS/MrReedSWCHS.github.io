# Tech Induction 2022

We hope you enjoyed the Induction at SWCHS this year. Here is some extra information for getting started on the Music Technology course.

Please get in touch with me at ereed-at-swchs.net if you have any questions.

# Preparing for September

These are the important things to get sorted before September:

1. Preparation work
1. Headphones
1. Revision Guide


## 1. Preparation Work

[Click here](https://github.com/reedmusic/reedmusic.github.io/raw/master/mt-induction2022/Tech Preparation.docx) to download the Preparation Work (you may need to right-click and Save As). Please bring this in September. Let me know if you have any questions.

## 2. Headphones

You will need a good-quality pair of headphones. You do not need to spend a lot of money, but the headphones must be designed for studio use.

These should be closed-back, circumaural (cover your ears entirely), wired headphones (not wireless, bluetooth,etc.).

Here are some suggestions:

* AKG K52
* Sennheiser HD206 (or HD201 which are cheaper and have a long cable for studio tracking)
* AKG K92
* Audio Technia ATH-M40x (I don’t recommend the cheaper M20x/M30x)
* Sony MDR-7506
* Audio Technica ATH-M50X
* Beyerdynamic DT770

## 3. Revision Guide

The Revision Guide (RRP £10) is excellent. It is concise and covers most of the course content. Make sure you buy the ‘A Level’ and not ‘AS Level’ version. It is not just for revision: we will be referring to the diagrams and explanations in class.

Shops are often out of stock when everyone starts courses in September, so buying this in advance is a good idea.
